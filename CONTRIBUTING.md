## Bugs

If you think you have found a bug in TauP, please file an issue
on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/crotwell/TauP/issues).
Try to include enough information for me to reproduce the
problem, ideally the full command line arguments and the
model file if you are using a non-standard model.
