The manual for the TauP Toolkit can be found in the doc directory.

We use gradle to compile TauP. Should you wish to recompile, the gradlew wrapper will download gradle and compile. For example 'gradlew jar' will compile the java source and create a new jar. 'gradle eclipse' will generate an eclipse project files for importing. More information can be found at http://www.gradle.org.
