This ``Beta'' version of the documentation is probably too detailed in 
some respects, and too vague in others. The version $1.0$ release of the 
TauP software will be accompanied by a manuscript submission to 
Seismology Research Letters, \cite{taupsrl}. This documentation is 
also intended as a preliminary draft of this manuscript. Comments on 
its suitability as both a software manual and a SRL
manuscript are appreciated.
