README      -- this file
lib         -- all the Java classes included in the package, along with
               saved models for prem, iasp91, and several other earth models.

               each will print a usage with a -help command line argument.
               The TAUP_HOME environment variable needs to be set for these
               scripts to work. .bat files for windows are also included.

               programs that use these classes

Installation:

More detailed installation instructions (and possibly more up to date) can be found in the manual. But for the impatent, here are the basics.

Unix:
1) Make sure a Java 1.1 virtual machine is installed. You can test this with 
      >java -version
2) Unzip and Untar the distribution, (you have likely already done this).
      >gunzip TauP.tar.gz
      >tar xvf TauP.tar
3) Add taup.jar to your CLASSPATH environment variable. For csh,
      >setenv CLASSPATH /home/me/TauP/taup.jar:${CLASSPATH}
4) Copy the wrapper scripts in TauP/bin to a directory referenced by your PATH
   environment variable.
      >cp TauP/bin/* /home/me/bin/.
5) Possibly resource your .cshrc and/or run the rehash command.
      >source ~/.cshrc
      >rehash
6) Run it.
      >taup_time -mod prem -h 100 -ph P,S,PcP,ScS,PKP,SKS,PKIKP,SKIKS
        ...

More detailed installation instructions are in an appendix to the manual, 
in the doc directory.
