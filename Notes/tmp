Subject: TauP status report/ bug fixes


Hi

Any beta testing that you want to do is appreciated!

thanks,
Philip

Recent bug fixes to TauP:

1) P410S is no illegal if this leg starts below the 410 and is downgoing.
This also makes P410P illegal in the same area, which seems reasonable
to me.

3) space - comma bug when inputing new phases in interactive mode

5) km/s is nomore, kmps is the only method now.

8) taup_pierce goes backwards for phases that go between 180 and 360
degrees. (Fixed a week ago)

9) P410P type phases have been fixed. They were getting a path that was
really Pv410P.

---------------------------------------
Left to fix:

2) P410S -> P409S on last column

4) taup_table

6) taup_path and last little section to the surface

7) different P and S linestyle in taup_path

10) review and update user's guide

11) add check at cusps of triplications to be sure the corner has been
found.
